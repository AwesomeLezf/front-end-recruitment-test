# Snowdog Front-end Recruitment test

* Please use real Github accounts.
* We are not answering any questions about this test. Everyone work with the same set of information, to let us fairly judge your work.
* Test is not a representation of the tech stack we are using in real projects.

## Before you start
* Fork this repository, it needs to stay on Github, publicly available.
* The test is based on [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/) a full stack Node.js framework, but you don't need to write any backend stuff, nor have any experience with Adonis or other similar framework.
* After installing the dependencies and running `npm run dev`, you should see a start page on http://localhost:3333. If something is wrong, you probably use a wrong version of Node.js.
