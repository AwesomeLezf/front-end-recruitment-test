# Snowdog Front-end Recruitment test

* Please use real Github accounts.
* We will not be responding to any questions about this test. All candidates will receive the same set of information for fairness.
* This test is not a representation of the tech stack we are using in real projects.

## Before you start
* Fork this repository; it needs to stay publicly available on Github.
* The test is based on [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/), a full stack Node.js framework, but you don't need to write anything for the backend, nor have any experience with Adonis or similar frameworks.
* After installing the dependencies and running `npm run dev`, you should see a start page on http://localhost:3333. If something goes wrong, you are probably using the wrong version of Node.js.

### Task
Take a look at the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/ppND0SVAQm1A7H39jABzSp/Front-end-Recruitment-test). Your task is to:

* Recreate the checkout form and provide your own JS validation.
* Send validated form data to the `POST /order` endpoint and show a success / error message based on the REST API response.


### Hints
* Use any way of writing styles you are comfortable with.
* By default Adonis supports [PostCSS](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/assets-manager#setup-postcss), [SASS, Less and Stylus](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/assets-manager#setup-sass-less-and-stylus) and you need to enable one of them, but it's just Webpack under the hood, so feel free to hook whatever you like the most.
* Endpoint accepted data formats:
  * Postal code: 00000
  * Phone number: 000000000
  * Credit card: 0000000000000000
  * CVV: 000
  * Exp. date: 00/00
